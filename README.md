# inclass-WebGL-cs-kilian

### Project description: 
This Project was intendet as an Unity Github and C# Exercise.
It contains a Button which triggers a public function for setting a Ball
randomly to 4 predefined positions. 
That was implemented using the c# Function Random.Range() and a SerializedField 
GameObject Array in which the predefined positions are saved.

To prevent that the Ball ist set to the same position in a row twice or more, i
wrote a while loop which repeats the Random.Range() Function as long as a new
position is found. Which might not be the most efficient way 
but for a Project that size it shouldn't be problem.
